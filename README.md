# Text-Readability
In this project, we're predicting the reading ease of excerpts from literature. We are provided with excerpts from several time periods and a wide range of reading ease scores.
We will be using Natural Language Processing (NLP) while dealing with text. Along with that we will be creating new features since the given data does not have many useful features. At last we will be building a deep neural network (DNN) model, with different layers, for prediction.
